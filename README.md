# Fake News Prediction 📰🔍

## Overview
This project is a **Fake News Prediction** model implemented in Python using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify news articles as **fake** or **real** based on textual features.

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled news articles with textual features that help distinguish between authentic and fake news.

## 📌 Features Used
- 📝 News Article Text
- 🏷️ Title
- 🏛️ Source
- 🔠 Word Frequency & TF-IDF Features
- 🧠 NLP-Based Features

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook
- 🏗️ Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 🤖 Scikit-Learn
- 📝 NLTK & SpaCy
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🚀 Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-prediction.git
   cd fake-news-prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run **Fake_News_Prediction.ipynb**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🏆 Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is preprocessed by tokenizing text, removing stopwords, and vectorizing using TF-IDF.
- Various ML models like Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated.
- Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (Replace with actual result).
- Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand key textual indicators.
